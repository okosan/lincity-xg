    <p style="htitle">Tips (rubbish dumps)</p>
    <p style="hp">Tips provide a place to put your rubbish. If you accumulate too much at markets, they are forced to burn some.
    This makes quite a lot of pollution so you should be wary of letting rubbish accumulate.</p>
    <p style="hp">As the tip is filled, it slowly turns into a hill, which is grassed over when it is full.</p>
    <p style="hp">If you clean up your city the trash from the tip can be re-excavated and processed
    in forests, electrified farms and recycling centers.</p>
    <p style="hp">You can see when a tip is working in the usual way, by clicking on it</p>
