	<p style="hp">Steel works produce steel from ore, power and jobs. Ore and jobs is obtained from the connected transport or markets.</p>
	<p style="hp">Power can be provided to the steel works in two ways. The first is burning coal. The second is from electricity, either inefficient kWh from connected transport or MWh directly from powerlines. Burning coal on site is more laborious. Windmills will barely provide enough power.</p>
